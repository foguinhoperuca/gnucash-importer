# Enviroment

It can't be used with virtualenv beacause of dependency on python3-gnucash deb package and gnucash itself.
So, you'll need install direct in OS with command:
```
jefferson@nami.jeffersoncampos.eti.br: ~/universal/projects/gnucash/gnucash-importer/ $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
